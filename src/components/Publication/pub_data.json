    "description": "The paper benchmarks spectral graph neural networks (GNNs), focusing on their ability to capture graph signals in the frequency domain. Despite their growing popularity, few studies systematically assess their spectral characteristics. This work categorizes over 30 GNNs with 27 filters, implementing them within a unified framework with optimized computations and training schemes. Through extensive experiments, the paper evaluates these models on effectiveness and efficiency, providing practical guidelines for selecting suitable spectral GNNs for large-scale tasks. The findings aim to aid in comparing performances and making informed decisions on model selection for specific scenarios.",

    "description": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) struggle with heterophily, where neighboring nodes are dissimilar, causing performance loss due to local and uniform aggregation. Existing methods incorporating global aggregation face scalability issues with O(n^2) complexity. This paper introduces SIMGA, a GNN that integrates SimRank for structural similarity as global aggregation. SIMGA's design is simple yet effective, achieving near-linear propagation efficiency to n. The paper theoretically demonstrates SIMGA's effectiveness and evaluates its performance on 12 benchmark datasets, often outperforming state-of-the-art models. Efficiency studies show SIMGA is up to 5Ã— faster than the best existing method on the largest heterophily dataset, Pokec, with over 30 million edges.",
